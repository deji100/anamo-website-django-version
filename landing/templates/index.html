                    The constant need in cybersecurity is deep forensic data collection. Unfortunately, many cybersecurity tools fail to effectively identify, collect, or interpret critical forensic data. For instance, systems with enabled logging often overlook critical alerts, treating them as white noise. Anamo addresses this by offering multi-level customization and prioritizing essential forensic information. This empowers InfoSec teams to precisely trace events, transactions, dates, times, and devices, improving their ability to respond to incidents effectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anamo excels in essential forensic data collection, particularly in tracking and analyzing the attributes of users and group permissions. This capability ensures precise monitoring of access controls and helps in identifying security risks tied to permission misuse or misconfiguration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anamo seamlessly gathers user and group permissions from both Windows and Linux operating systems, displaying them in their native formats (numeric or symbolic). This automated process enables InfoSec administrators to interrogate key details such as hosts and paths, providing comprehensive oversight of permissions across diverse environments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anamo tracks even the most nuanced permission changes, allowing administrators to set the urgency of alerts for such events. It autonomously collects data, providing detailed forensic tracking and displaying both alerts and data in a logical format for efficient remediation and investigation. This ensures admins can respond swiftly to changes while maintaining deep visibility into their systems.

                    You know the question, the one where people ask, “And then…
                    what do we do with those Logs?” In reality, Logs serve an
                    important purpose but unfortunately, they do so after the
                    fact. Anamo understands what the purpose of Logs are, but
                    rather than collecting them (which is always a good idea),
                    Anamo interprets the meaning, actions, and behavior of the
                    User (or Group) to essentially monitor, notify, and alert
                    Admins to the actions of a Technical-Adversary (Authorized
                    or not) who might be categorized as a suspicious or bad
                    actor. Today, that problem is solved through the ingenious
                    and tastefully presented user interface that does not
                    require a computer science degree to immediately gain the
                    gist and detail that has been woven into the Anamo fabric.

                    Anamo is continuous diagnostics and mitigation, it delivers
                    “always-on” vulnerability assessment scanning and no
                    competitor can scan as often or as deeply as Anamo. There
                    are many types of “external scanners”, but they are not
                    behind the firewall and limited to the type of data that the
                    scanner can collect, this limitation leaves the customer
                    with (potentially) knowing the problem but without the
                    essential ability to receive remediation validation in
                    real-time. VM (Virtual-Machine) based Nodes are also able to
                    scan for CVE’s and are able to evaluate a client
                    vulnerability risk posture more rapidly than external
                    scanners; however, they all remain limited in their ability
                    to gather critical and essential data for decision-makers in
                    real-time. VM’s do not reside within the Host and therefore
                    cannot gather the same deep-seeded OS Level information that
                    the Anamo Agent continuously gathers 24/7/365.

                    Easily identifiable differentiators: Scanners cannot see
                    beyond a named software and have zero insight into the
                    packages that make up the software. VM’s – posing as
                    internal scanning node are not agent-based, an extremely
                    limited purview into a devices operating system, but they
                    can reach limited information from more devices without an
                    Agent. The Anamo Agent sits directly upon the protected
                    system and is intimately knowledgeable with nearly every
                    single attribute and possible attack vector far beyond
                    software and all the way down to a user, their permissions,
                    and subsequent behavioral modifications.

                    Anamo is the answer to identifying a Technical Adversary and

                    Anamo CDM provides an AI and ML-driven SaaS that is
                    disrupting the classic and stagnated Cybersecurity-Silos of
                    old such as Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP), Endpoint
                    Detection and Remediation (EDR), Attack Surface Management
                    (ASM), Software Vulnerability Management (SVM), and Security
                    Event Incident Management (SIEM), just to name a few. While
                    Anamo isn’t a Silver-Bullet for every Cybersecurity
                    challenge, one look through any of the Gartner Reports (see
                    embedded links) will show that Anamo merges many of the best
                    attributes of these aforementioned security functions into a
                    single platform and delivers a comprehensive, user-friendly,
                    and financially attractive entry-point and value proposition
                    that legacy platforms simply cannot compete with.

                    Anamo knew that no other software product could deliver
                    risk-rated software CVE analytics with remediation
                    recommendations on both Windows and Linux Operating Systems,
                    and at the same time separated and categorized those
                    vulnerabilities by Host , Version, Build, Package, OS,
                    Kernel, Impact, and Score all on the same page. So Anamo
                    built that. But that wasn’t going to be enough for Anamo
                    customers, clients wanted deep software and historical
                    forensics with data analytics, along with transaction
                    history, and they demanded that the information be
                    constantly updated and delivered to an active dashboard in
                    near real-time. So Anamo did that too!

                    Before one can anticipate achieving ZTA with any platform or
                    service, entities will first require the initial ability to
                    gather and understand correlated data. These trust
                    indicators should include, at a minimum, Cybersecurity risk
                    data related to identity attributes concerning Users,
                    Groups, Port, and Permissions, all in an effort to ensure
                    that they have correct and robust data forensics gathering
                    capability for validation and verification purposes.

                  <p>
                    Anamo is essentially your trusted 3rd party validation

                    Simply stated, ZTA is a multi-faceted aspect of
                    Cybersecurity which includes a clear understanding and the
                    ability to track each and every User or Group of Users IDs
                    within select computing systems. At a highly granular-level,
                    Anamo tracks, documents, and even alerts InfoSec team
                    members of any modifications of individuals, groups, ports,
                    or permissions including Adds, Changes, Deletes, and more.

                    To accommodate various Federal Regulatory Compliance (GRC)
                    requirements, the “GRC” (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)
                    Platform is 100% encrypted and delivers a highly secured
                    platform to qualified clients who deal with CUI, PII, or
                    other sensitive, controlled, or regulated information. The
                    GRC APP enables On-Demand assessment management, policy,

                    instant Security System Plans (SSP) or Facility Security
                    Plans (FSP). Additionally, the GRC manages compliance
